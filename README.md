# Cycling Own Type

Simple blog page, created in purpose to learn new technologies. I just wanted to compare the speed of aplications created in Next.js and pure React.js (obviously, when are created with my level of skills). The website has main functionalities like: adding new post using CMS, filtering, display single post.

##### Technologies:

1. Next.js
2. Typescript
3. Sanity
4. Tailwindcss
